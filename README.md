The idea behind this project is quite simple.
- we are inside the room, we can move using wsad, and also move camera using mouse
- there will be some object like tennis ball that is constantly bouncing
- the movement speed of the object depends on user movement speed just like in game SUPER HOT

I'll mosty use here C++ for graphic and probably LUA LÃ–VE for scripting movement
